 I developed an innovative face detection attendance system. This project leverages advanced computer vision techniques to accurately identify individuals and mark their attendance, streamlining the process and enhancing security. By integrating machine learning algorithms and a user-friendly interface, we've created a reliable and efficient solution that can be utilized in various environments such as schools, offices, and events. Our collaborative effort has resulted in a system that not only automates attendance tracking but also reduces the risk of errors associated with traditional methods.
